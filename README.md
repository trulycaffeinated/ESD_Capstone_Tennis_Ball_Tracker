# Tennis Ball Tracker ESD : Capstone Project
FPGA-oriented tennis ball tracker using stereo vision and MATLAB–Blender simulation to estimate 3D ball position, evaluate accuracy under motion, compute coefficient of restitution, and perform in/out detection with visualization.
## Project Description and Matlab Intro
---
Likely tasks...
- system architecture **(group) (PRD)**
- firmware (labs)
- software (labs)
- gui (labs)
- algorithm development (labs)
- system integration (Everybody - everything coming together)
- system and subsystem testing **(Jeff preferably)**
- program management (cost & schedule) 
- risk assessment and mitigation **(Kinda goes in hand w/ testing but everyone can contribute if they see a risk)**
- Documentation **(Jeff preferably)**

### 🎯 Core technical pieces

1. **Ball position accuracy (static camera)** – 15 pts  **(THIS IS *MOSTLY* LAB #1)*
    → How accurate is your 3D position estimate across X/Y/Z?
2. **Camera motion accuracy (static ball)** – 15 pts  
    → How bad does error get when the camera shifts (wind simulation)?
3. **Coefficient of restitution** – 10 pts  
    → Measure how “bouncy” the court is using physics + tracking.
4. **LED visualization** – 10 pts  
    → Green LED = in  
    → Red LED blinking at **10 Hz, 50% duty** = out
5. **Full tennis tracker demo** – 40 pts
    - Track **5 serves**
    - Track **5 volleys**
    - Show **instant replay**
    - GUI matters a LOT here
6. **Professionalism & documentation** – 10 pts  
    → This is where teams lose easy points 💀
